## Notes
While I was building this app. I had to first create the whole skeleton of the project. I found myself thinking of more things I could do. **FireStore** did make some things easier for me. For instance, when getting data from the  Firestore database and when setting up a listener to stay up to date.
NumberMate is an app that lets you guess other people’s hidden 4 digit number. In doing so, that player gets a point every time he/she gets another person’s number.
